During [Dwarf Lab's livestream](https://www.youtube.com/live/5VJQMcWNqiU?feature=share&t=2096) on April 27, 2023, they mention the API will be released after the engineers finish updating the app. They  also posted a link to the [draft specs for the API](https://uploads.gorgias.io/g5KDM28W3V69aByw/DWARF_II_API_V1.0-704a098a-9c08-4add-9c12-120a92f3eec5.pdf?fbclid=IwAR2lQTZ8CkEc1N2g83v-tN6Dc-Q0nDW2DFfM7Ek4GSaJf8pzv1AMpk3E0fk). There is a good amount of options in the API spec. The communication protocol is websockets and the communication data type is json.
